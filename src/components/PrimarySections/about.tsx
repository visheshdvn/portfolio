          Greetings, I am Vishesh Dhawan. I am a passionate software engineer
          from India specializing in Full-Stack Web and Blockchain Development.
          When I&apos;m not immersed in code, you&apos;ll find me enjoying the
          melodies of music and strumming my guitar. I am always curious to
          learning new technologies and turning ideas into reality with them.

          Consultancy Services - TCS) in Pune India. Before joining Digitate, I
          did my software engineering internship at Hitachi Vantara.

          webpages on the internet.

          Through out this journey I have gained immense experience from the
          people I have worked with, enhanced my technical & communication
          skills and also learnt to think more like a client than a developer.

          Creating Fun projects with a full time job is hard, but I make sure to
          find my way around and create some interesting stuff in the moments I
          find for myself.

          I am a challeng driven person. I like to brainstorm ideas, find
          creative ways to solve problems, build something useful along the way.
          What can be a better way to do so than building some cool apps?
