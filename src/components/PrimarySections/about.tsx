          Currently, I am working full-time as a software developer (frontend)
          in Digitate (a venture of Tata Consultancy Services - TCS) in Pune
          India. Before joining Digitate (TCS), I did my software engineering
          internship at Hitachi Vantara.

          I have also worked in some startups and helped them launch their first
          webpages on the internet.

        <p className="about-para">
          Through out this journey I have gained immense experience from the
          people I have worked with, learnt to communicate with different people
          and think more like a client than a developer when it needs to.

          Creating Fun projects with a full time job is hard.. But I make sure
          to find my way around and create some interesting stuff in the moments
          I find for myself.

          I am a challenges driven person. I like to brainstorm ideas, find
          creative ways to solve problems, build something useful along the way.
          What can be a better way to do so than building some cool apps?
